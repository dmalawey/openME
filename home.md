##  About

This repository is for a full, unedited, uncut mechanical engineering degree with exams, homeworks, projects, and ABET accreditation.

I have never yet found a full mechanical engineering degree online, complete & worked out by a human being, with all mistakes etc.  It just seems it ought to exist.  Hope this can be made useful.

The more I learn about engineers in society, it seems their strongest hesitations to make improvements relate to the fear of messing up.  But I messed up a lot.  So, perhaps this repository can stand as encouragement.  I earned summa cum laude but at the time it did not seem like I was good enough.  It came as a surprise with the final GPA and it almost felt like some professors had maybe bumped up my grades due to effort.  I might never know.  But effort is important.
