##  About

Explore this repository to learn mechanical engineering.  During 2025 I'll upload a full, unmodified, uncut mechanical engineering degree with exams, homeworks, projects, and ABET accreditation.

Why? I have never yet found a full mechanical engineering degree online, complete & worked out by a human being, with all mistakes etc.  It just seems it ought to exist.  Hope this can be made useful.

The more I learn about engineers in society, it seems their strongest hesitations to make improvements relate to the fear of messing up.  But I messed up a lot.  So, perhaps this repository can stand as encouragement.  I earned summa cum laude but at the time it did not seem like I was good enough.  It came as a surprise with the final GPA and it almost felt like some professors had maybe bumped up my grades due to effort.  I might never know.  But effort is important.

# Motivation

Lenonardo Davinci was a mechanical engineer among other things.  This webpage has several reasons to exist, but one is to spread the power of a great mind.  You can indisbutably learn enough using only this webpage, to understand the full body of inventions of Leonardo Da Vinci and this understanding is a source of untold power.  Over time I discovered it to be more and more rare for an engineer, with or without a degree, to have this understanding.   Attached below is a nicely compressed copy of Davinci's works at only 30MB.

## Outline

Here is a snapshot of a mechanical engineering 4-year degree, with the list of courses taken.  These courses may vary by institution, but around the world the ME degree is fairly standard and this snapshot is a decent representation.
