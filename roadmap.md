## Whats-here
_a brief intro for the purpose of this page: I'd like to share some info that does not quite fit into the other categories (curriculum, or individual career paths) and I'll post it here.  The intention is to only post information which has recurring value in the context of our conversations in the Discord, or other P2P chats about the future of robotics, the nation, the society, or inventors' roles in general.

* This paper titled "inevitable designs" is a discussion intended to separate true value of a design from the transient world of economics, demands, styles, and cultural impacts on what we perceive as valuable.  For me, it is a guiding arrangement of principles that helps to make decisions about how to prioritize design plans.
