# National Roadmap, USA, 2025
Development of technology as a force for good, for progress, and for prosperity, is a set of two vectors.  We learn and teach from the ground up, and we lead from the top down. Leadership is as crucial as learning.  Since that is so, I'll post some information here with minimal context and as the information grows I will answer more questions about it.  -David M 2025.02.03
