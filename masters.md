Graduate level contents for Mechanical Engineering

## Thesis
A thesis is a core requirement of a Master of Science in engineering, for all ABET-accredited programs to my knowledge.  About half of the efforts of a masters degree is in coursework while the other half is in research efforts, and the thesis is the culmination of the research. The thesis for an MS degree is analogous to the Dissertation of a doctoral degree, but usually smaller and less intensive.

For this thesis on micro-satellite design, I applied existing graduate level engineering and generated new knowledge based on the results of a project.  The new results focus on an implemenation of optimization algorithms for a multidisciplinary design.  Something novel about this work is the blending of heuristic and gradient based algorithms for optimization.  Heuristic algorithms can produce nondeterministic results, with a factor of randomness, while the gradient based algorithms are purely mathematical, fully repeatable given the input dataset, and can be subject to imperfections in the input data.  This project uses fundamental mathematics that are equivalent to today's popular algorithms behind the big Artificial Intelligence inventions that are moving technology into a new space.
