# Courses
Mechanical Engineering Courses, organized by course curriculums.

_note: engineering knowledge is not fundamentally divided into these topics such as statics and dynamics. But in education and science, we assign these categories of engineering topics that are fairly recognized around the world.  Each individual course may also correspond to a specialty that characterizes an entire lifelong career of an expert in the field._

## IDE110-Mechanics of Materials
Mechanics of Materials applies physics to physical materials.  Deformation, bending, loads, strain, yield strength, elastic modulus, are concepts put to work in Mechanics of Materials.  IDE stands for interdisciplinary engineering, and this course is assigned to IDE because several curriculums stand on mechanics, such as Structural Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Civil Engineering, and so-on.  IDE110 was the course title (with 3 credit hours) and IDE120 was the lab title (an additional 1 or 2 credit hours, with one long meeting per week and a report following).

## ME160-Dynamics
Dynamics is physics applied to moving bodies.  Compute linear and rotating masses, forces, accelerations, and stored energy for machines.

## ME219-Thermodynamics
Thermodynamics is about energy.  We use thermo to measure, compute, control the flow of energy in various states.  Energy, heat, light, sound, flow, compression, waves, are all fundamentally energy and they follow the laws of thermodynamics.

# ME240 Instrumentation
Beginning with the best part, the powerpoint slides by Mitch Cottrell.  He was a nonprofessor teaching staff with loads of knowledge & made top notch content to teach instrumentation.  I think this was my favorite course from undergrad.
