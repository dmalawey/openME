# Courses
Mechanical Engineering Courses, organized by course curriculums.

_note: engineering knowledge is not fundamentally divided into these topics such as statics and dynamics. But in education and science, we assign these categories of engineering topics that are fairly recognized around the world.  Each individual course may also correspond to a specialty that characterizes an entire lifelong career of an expert in the field._

## Thermodynamics
Thermodynamics is about energy.  We use thermo to measure, compute, control the flow of energy in various states.  Energy, heat, light, sound, flow, compression, waves, are all fundamentally energy and they follow the laws of thermodynamics.

## Mechanics of Materials
Mechanics of Materials applies physics to physical materials.  Deformation, bending, loads, strain, yield strength, elastic modulus, are concepts put to work in Mechanics of Materials.

## Dynamics
Dynamics is physics applied to moving bodies.  Compute linear and rotating masses, forces, accelerations, and stored energy for machines.

# ME240 Instrumentation
Beginning with the best part, the powerpoint slides by Mitch Cottrell.  He was a nonprofessor teaching staff with loads of knowledge & made top notch content to teach instrumentation.  I think this was my favorite course from undergrad.
